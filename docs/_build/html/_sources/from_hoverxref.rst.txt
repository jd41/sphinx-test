Welcome to sphinx-hoverxref!
============================

``sphinx-hoverxref`` is a Sphinx_ extension to show a floating window (*tooltips* or *modal* dialogues) on the cross references of the documentation embedding the content of the linked section on them. With ``sphinx-hoverxref``, you don't need to click a link to see what's in there.


Usage
-----

To show a floating window, use the role ``hoverxref`` to link to any document or section and embed its content into it.
We currently support two different types of floating windows: Tooltip and Modal.


      This will :hoverxref:`show a floating window <hoverxref_file:hoverxref_section>` in the linked words.
